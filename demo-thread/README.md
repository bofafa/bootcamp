### Thread
  - Thread is a task <- worker, payment worker, payment agnet, 
  - extend Thread, then you know the payment the class is for payment
  - extend 即開即用, method
  - Thread.start() - > run thread -> Sysout
  - Atomic use in Task, 不被入侵
  - thread - safe？？
  - Task is worker, 
  - thread no auttbite
  - methoed 係死物, static method is Thread-safe. 通常唔會look up 出面嘅野
  - deadlock is like a key, 最少要2支thread 搶key
  - 兩支thread 的task share resourse, 搶key 去syn， 又唔可以得一個synconize, 一間房有通道去第二間房，
   instance method 跟object, key 跟object
   ## ventor and hashtable 都好少用，舊嘢
